# Welcome to ccCultura

This will be a reimplementation of the static [ccCultura site](http://cccultura.com) as a dynamic Rails site.

The objective of this site is to provide speakers of English with basic information about cultural institutions in the city of São Paulo, Brazil. Although there is a wealth of information online about São Paulo’s museums, research institutions, theaters, etc., uncovering these resources can prove to be overwhelming for those who do not speak Portuguese. This directory incorporates information from the institutions themselves, from government and cultural organizations documents, and from sources that are licenced through [Creative Commons](http://creativecommons.org/about).
